Once there lived a young man.
That young man used to study in his country's best institute.
There also studied a young girl.
The young man met that young girl at their library.
Then they went to a park along with some other people.
The boy liked that girl.
Then they didn't see each other for a long time.
Until, they went to a tour in winter vacation.
They had been closer than ever.
The boy didn't think of anything else.
Until, at some point, the girl started to avoid the boy.
That broke his heart.
The boy was kind of lost.
